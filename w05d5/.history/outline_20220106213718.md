## User Stories


## Nouns are Resources. They are the Entities for your ERD
* every entity needs its own table
* make an ERD


## Make a planning directory in the git repo
* user-stories.md
* ERDv3.png


## Define Routes to the Resources (REST API for each Resources)
* client needs a way to update/delete things in the db
* if it's an action, the path is singular
* if it's a resources, the path is plural

B   GET   /widgets
R   GET   /widgets/:id
E   POST  /widgets/:id/edit    (PUT/PATCH?)
A   POST  /widgets
D   POST  /widgets/:id/delete  (DELETE?)

Consider (and probably make) each of these BREAD endpoints for each of your resources.
